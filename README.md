#### *Program created as a school assignment, not meant for distribution*

This simple program measures the performance of a computer's CPU. It computes a score by performing matrix inversions and 
quicksorts of array. The computing advantage of multiple CPU cores can be seen by running multiple copies of this
program in parallel.

See pdf for more details, including visual representations of results.
